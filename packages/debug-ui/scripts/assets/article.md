# Eureka!
What you're seeing here right now is Jouranlism Reinvented!
This article is loaded from Ethereum blockchain using the Civil Ecosystem!

## Wait, start from beginning
Ok, so [Civil](http://joincivil.com) is a New York based startup whose goal
is to reinvent the business model of journalism in the internet and decentralization era.

There's a big problem with fake news lately, and so Civil, by leveraging Ethereum,
is creating an ecosystem that through economic incentives promotes high-quality
news and journalism being produced.

## So how did this article work?
This article is loaded using our [open-source civil.ts library](https://github.com/joincivil/civil.ts), it talks with our [smart-contracts deployed on Ethereum](https://github.com/joincivil/contracts) and the content itself is stored
on a Github gist, because why not.
