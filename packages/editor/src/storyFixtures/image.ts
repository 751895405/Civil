In the nineteen-nineties, he noticed the jobs that two modern steel mills, owned by a company called Nucor, had brought to Blytheville, twenty miles farther up the Mississippi River, and he spent more than a decade trying to lure a similar facility to Osceola—using the city’s resources to buy a power plant so that it could sell electricity cheaply and preserving land by the river for industry rather than residential development.",
